## Migration

The migration happens in subsequent stages while the service is online. First all users need to migrate to the new architecture, then the data on disk can be migrated user by user by switching the storage driver.

### User Stories
As an admin I need to avoid downtime.
As an admin I want to migrate certain groups of users before others.
As a user, I need a seamless migration and not lose data by any chance.

### Stage-0
Is the pre-migration stage having a functional ownCloud 10 instance.

### Stage-1
Introduce OpenID Connect to server and Clients

### Stage-2
Install and introduce ownCloud Web and let users test it voluntarily.

### Stage-3
Start oCIS backend and make read only tests on existing data using the `owncloud` storage driver which will read (and write)
- blobs from the same datadirectory layout as in ownCloud 10 and
- metadata from the ownCloud 10 databas
The oCIS share manager will read share infomation from the owncloud database as well.
- [ ] *we need a share manager that can read from the oc 10 db as well as from whatever new backend will be used for a pure oCIS setup. Currently, that would be the json file. Or that is migrated after all users have switched to oCIS. -- jfd*

### Stage-4
Test writing data with oCIS into the existing ownCloud 10 datafolder using the `owncloud` storage driver.

### Stage-5
Introduce reverse proxy and switch over early adoptors, let admins gain trust in the new backend by comparing metrics of the two systems and having it running in parallel.

### Stage-6
Voluntary transition period and subsequent hard deadline for all users

### Stage-7
Disable oc10 in the proxy, all requests are now handled by oCIS, shut down oc10 web servers and redis (or keep for calendar & contacts only? rip out files from oCIS?)

### Stage-8
User by user storage migration from owncloud driver to `ocis`/`s3ng`/`cephfs`...

### Stage-9
Migrate share data to &lt;yet to determine&gt; share manager backend and shut down owncloud database

### Stage-10
Profit! (db for file metadata no longer necessary, less maintenance effort)


## Architectural differences

The fundamental difference between ownCloud 10 and oCIS is that the file metadata is moved from the database in the `oc_filecache` table (which is misnamed, as it actually is an index) to the storage provider who can place metadata as close to the underlying storage system as possible. In effect, the file metadata is sharded over multiple specialized services.


## Data that will be migrated

Currently, oCIS focuses on file sync and share use cases. 

### Blob data

In ownCloud 10 the files are laid out on disk in the *data directory* using the following layout:
```

│   │   ├── Photos

```

The *data directory* may also contain subfolders for owncloud 10 applications like `avatars`, `gallery`, `files_external` and `cache`.

When an objectstorage is used as the primary storage all file blobs are stored by their file id and a prefix, eg.: `urn:oid:<fileid>`.

The three types of blobs we need to migrate are stored in 
- `files` for file blobs, the current file content,
- `files_trashbin` for trashed files (and their versions) and 
- `files_versions` for file blobs of older versions.

### Filecache table

In both cases the file metadata, including a full replication of the file tree, is stored in the `oc_filecache`  table of an ownCloud 10 database. The primary key of a row is the file id. It is used to attach additional metadata like shares, tags, favorites or arbitrary file properties.

The `filecache` table itself has more metadata:

> Note: for EOS a hot migration only works seamlessly if file ids in oc10 are already read from eos. otherwise either a mapping from the oc10 filecache file id to the new eos file id has to be created under the assumption that these id sets do not intersect or files and corresponding shares need to be exported and imported offline to generate a new set of ids. While this will preserve public links, user, group and even federated shares, old internal links may still point to different files because they contain the oc10 fileid 

### share table

- Public links
- Private shares with users and groups
- Federated shares *partly*

In the CS3 API
1. public links are handled by the PublicShareProvider using the [Link API](https://cs3org.github.io/cs3apis/#cs3.sharing.link.v1beta1.LinkAPI)
2. internal shares are handled by the UserShareProvider using the [Collaboration API](https://cs3org.github.io/cs3apis/#cs3.sharing.collaboration.v1beta1.CollaborationAPI). This covers user and group shares.
3. federated shares are handled by the OcmShareProvider using the [OCM Share Provider AP](https://cs3org.github.io/cs3apis/#cs3.sharing.ocm.v1beta1.OcmAPI) aka. Open Cloud Mesh.

*TODO clarify how OCM handles this andt where we store / configure this. It seems related to trusted IdPs*

### user data

Users are migrated in two steps:
1. They should all be authenticated using openid connect, which already moves them to a common identity management system.
2. To search share recipients, both, ownCloud 10 and oCIS need acces to the same user directory using eg. LDAP.

### LDAP

TODO clarify if metadata from ldap & user_shibboleth needs to be migrated
-  the `dn` -> *owncloud internal username* mapping that currently lives in the `oc_ldap_user_mapping` table needs to move into a dedicated ownclouduuid attribute in the LDAP server. The idp should send it as a claim so the proxy does not have to look up the user using LDAP again. The username cannot be changed in ownCloud 10 and the oCIS provisioning API will not allow changing it as well. When we introduce the graph api we may allow changing usernames when all clients have moved to that api.

The problem is that the username in owncloud 10 and in oCIS also need to be the same, which might not be the case when the ldap mapping used a different column. In that case we should add another owncloudusername attribute to the ldap server ...
